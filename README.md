A portable, agent-friendly skill library served as an MCP server. Drop it into any project and AI agents across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and Continue instantly have access to structured guidance for website design, development, and growth tasks — without copying a single file.

## Install

Run once in any project directory:

```bash
npx @coastdigitalgroup/coastai-skills --install
```

The installer auto-detects every supported editor on the machine, writes the MCP server entry into each config, and adds a `CLAUDE.md` instruction so agents know to use skills automatically. Restart your editor and it is live.

---

## How it works

The MCP server exposes three tools agents call on demand:

| Tool | What it does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `search_skills(query)` | Finds relevant skills by keyword — use this first |
| `list_skills(category?)` | Browses all skills, optionally filtered by category |
| `get_skill(name)` | Loads the full skill content by exact name |

Typical agent flow:

```text
User:  "Help me build an accessible modal dialog"
Agent: search_skills("modal dialog accessible")
       → accessible-modal-dialog (website-development)
Agent: get_skill("accessible-modal-dialog")
       → full workflow, decision rules, validation steps
Agent: executes with skill guidance
```

Skills are never injected into context upfront. The agent fetches exactly what it needs, when it needs it.

## Adding skills

The library is domain-agnostic. Add any topic by dropping a folder into a category directory:

```text
/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Each `SKILL.md` requires a frontmatter block. The `description` is what agents use to decide if a skill is relevant:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description:
  One or two sentences explaining what this skill does and when to trigger it.
  Write it as if the agent is reading it to decide whether to load the skill.
---
```

The MCP server discovers new skills automatically — no code changes or rebuilds needed.

Optional support folders alongside `SKILL.md`:

- `examples/` — worked examples
- `templates/` — reusable files
- `references/` — detailed reference material
- `assets/` — images or other static files
- `scripts/` — deterministic helper scripts

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coastdigitalgroup/coast-ai-skills.git
cd coast-ai-skills
npm install
npm run build
```

| Command | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `npm run build` | Compiles TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting files |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over `src/` |
| `npm run dev` | Runs the MCP server directly via tsx |

The MCP server source lives in `src/`. Skills live in the category folders at the repo root. They are independent — editing skills never requires a rebuild.
