# Responsive Grid System

## Purpose

The Responsive Grid System skill provides a structured foundation for organizing content on a webpage. By using a consistent set of columns, gutters, and margins, this system ensures visual alignment, maintains hierarchy, and simplifies the transition of designs across different screen sizes (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).

## Use Cases

- Designing the structural layout of a new website or application.
- Building a UI kit or design system component library.
- Organizing complex content like dashboards or data-heavy interfaces.
- Ensuring a consistent vertical rhythm and horizontal alignment across multiple pages.

## When NOT to Use

- **Experimental/Brutalist Designs:** When the visual goal is to intentionally break standard layout conventions for artistic effect.
- **Single-Purpose Simple Pages:** When the content is so minimal (e.g., a single centered form) that a full grid system adds unnecessary overhead.
- **Fixed-Width Environments:** When the output is strictly for a non-responsive medium (though a grid is still useful for alignment).

## Inputs

To establish a responsive grid system, you need:
1. **Device Breakpoints:** The screen widths where the layout changes (e.g., 600px, 900px, 1200px).
2. **Column Counts:** Number of vertical tracks for content at each breakpoint (standard: 12 for desktop, 4 for mobile).
3. **Gutter Width:** The space between columns (e.g., 16px, 24px).
4. **Outer Margins:** The padding on the left and right edges of the viewport (e.g., 20px on mobile, 5% or fixed max-width on desktop).
5. **Content Requirements:** A list of components and their relative priority/size.

## Outputs

1. **Grid Specification:** A definition of columns, gutters, and margins for each major breakpoint.
2. **Layout Map:** A visual or descriptive guide showing how components span columns at different sizes.
3. **Implementation Logic:** CSS (Grid or Flexbox) properties to realize the system.

## Workflow

### 1. Define Breakpoints

Select the key screen widths where your layout needs to adapt.
*Common Scale:*
- **Mobile:** 0 - 599px
- **Tablet:** 600px - 899px
- **Desktop:** 900px+ (with a max-width container around 1200px-1440px)

### 2. Set Column & Gutter Parameters

Determine the "inner logic" of the grid.
- **Mobile:** 4 columns, 16px gutters, 16px margins.
- **Tablet:** 8 columns, 24px gutters, 32px margins.
- **Desktop:** 12 columns, 24px gutters, auto margins (centered container).

### 3. Establish Container Behavior

Decide if the grid is **Fluid** (scales as a percentage of viewport), **Fixed** (stays at a specific width until the next breakpoint), or **Adaptive** (a mix). *Recommendation:* Use a fluid grid with a fixed `max-width`, sized with `clamp()` (e.g., `max-width: clamp(320px, 90vw, 1440px)`) so the container scales smoothly instead of jumping at breakpoints.

### 4. Map Content to the Grid

Assign components to span specific column counts using CSS Grid (`grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr)` with `grid-column: span N`), not float or inline-block hacks.
*Example:* A sidebar might span 3 columns on desktop (12-col grid), while the main content spans 9. On mobile, both would span all 4 columns (stacking).

For components nested inside a grid cell that need to align to the parent grid's tracks (e.g., a card's internal header/body/footer lining up with sibling cards), use `subgrid` (`grid-template-columns: subgrid` or `grid-template-rows: subgrid`) rather than re-declaring a new independent grid.

Where a component's internal layout depends on its own available space rather than the viewport (e.g., a card that should reflow from 1 to 2 columns based on the width of its container, not the screen), use a **container query** (`container-type: inline-size` on the wrapper, `@container (min-width: …)` on the child) instead of a media query.

### 5. Define Stacking & Ordering

Determine how elements move when the screen shrinks. Usually, elements on the left stack on top of elements on the right. Use logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`) for grid gutters and margins so the system adapts correctly to RTL layouts without separate overrides.

## Decision Rules

- **The 12-Column Rule:** Use a 12-column grid for desktop because it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, offering maximum flexibility.
- **Consistency:** Use the same gutter width throughout a single breakpoint to maintain alignment.
- **Mobile First:** Always design the 4-column mobile layout first to ensure core content is prioritized.
- **The "Safety Zone":** Ensure outer margins are large enough to prevent content from touching the screen edges on mobile devices.
- **Viewport vs. Container:** Use media queries for page-level, viewport-driven layout shifts (e.g., the overall column count). Use container queries when a component must adapt to its own box size regardless of viewport (e.g., the same card component reflowing differently in a sidebar vs. a full-width section).

## Constraints

- **Accessibility:** Ensure that when columns shrink, text remains legible and tap targets (buttons) remain large enough — WCAG 2.2 (2.5.8) sets an absolute floor of 24x24px, with 44x44px preferred for primary actions.
- **Responsiveness:** No element should have a fixed pixel width that exceeds the mobile viewport width (avoid horizontal scrolling).
- **Hierarchy:** Use the grid to reinforce importance; more important elements should typically span more columns or appear higher in the stack.

## Common Failure Patterns

- **Inconsistent Gutters:** Using different spacing between different columns, which breaks the visual "line".
- **Gutter-less Design:** Placing content right against each other without breathing room (unless intentional for imagery).
- **Over-Complexity:** Creating too many breakpoints for minor adjustments, leading to unmaintainable CSS.
- **Ignoring the "In-Between":** Testing only at 320px and 1440px but ignoring how the layout looks at 800px or 1024px.

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Content is perfectly aligned to the vertical lines of the grid.
- [ ] No horizontal scrollbars appear at any viewport width from 320px to 2560px.
- [ ] The transition between breakpoints feels logical and content remains readable.
- [ ] Gutters and margins remain consistent across the entire page.
- [ ] The system is implemented using relative units (%, fr, rem) rather than hardcoded pixels for column widths.
- [ ] Container queries are used (instead of viewport media queries) for components whose layout should depend on their own box size.
- [ ] Tap targets meet at least the WCAG 2.2 24x24px minimum.
