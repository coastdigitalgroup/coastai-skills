  Audit and optimize pricing pages to improve conversion rates, increase Average
  Order Value (AOV), and reduce choice paralysis. Trigger this skill when a
  pricing page has a high exit rate, low conversion to checkout, or users are
  confused about which plan to choose.

# Pricing Page Optimization

## Purpose

The Pricing Page Optimization skill provides a structured framework for auditing
and improving the layout, information architecture, and psychological triggers
of a pricing page. It aims to reduce cognitive load, guide users toward the most
appropriate plan (usually the most profitable or best-value "Goldilocks"
option), and address final objections before the checkout process begins.

## Use Cases

- High exit rates on the pricing page.
- Users frequently asking sales/support which plan they should choose.
- Lower than expected Average Order Value (AOV).
- Re-launching pricing after a product or service update.
- SaaS businesses looking to optimize "Self-Serve" conversion paths.

## When NOT to Use

- **Simple E-commerce Product Pages:** Single-product pages should use product
  detail page (PDP) optimization instead.
- **Enterprise-Only Custom Quotes:** If there are no public tiers and only a
  "Contact Us" button, focus on lead capture form optimization.
- **Dynamic Bidding/Auction Sites:** Where price is not fixed or tiered.

## Inputs

1. **Current Pricing Model:** Tiers, features per tier, and pricing
   (monthly/annual).
2. **Target Audience Segments:** Who is each tier designed for? (e.g.,
   "Freelancer," "Growing Team," "Enterprise").
3. **Analytics Data:** Page views, conversion rate to checkout/signup, exit
   rate, and most selected plan.
4. **Primary Goal:** (e.g., "Increase Pro plan adoption," "Maximize total
   signups").
5. **Customer Objections:** Common reasons why users hesitate to buy (e.g., "Is
   it secure?", "Can I cancel?").

## Outputs

1. **Pricing Page Audit:** Identification of friction points, choice paralysis,
   or weak value communication.
2. **Optimized Tier Structure:** Recommendations for plan naming, feature
   highlighting, and price presentation.
3. **Copy & Psychological Triggers:** Updated headlines, plan descriptions, and
   "Most Popular" or "Best Value" badges.
4. **Objection Handling Recommendations:** Strategically placed FAQs, trust
   signals, and risk reversal (guarantees).

## Workflow

### 1. Audit Choice Architecture

- **Plan Count:** Are there more than 4 plans? (More than 4 often leads to
  choice paralysis).
- **Plan Differentiation:** Is it immediately obvious how Plan A differs from
  Plan B?
- **Visual Weight:** Is the "Target Plan" visually distinct from the others?

### 2. Optimize Information Hierarchy

- **Plan Naming:** Do names reflect the user persona (e.g., "Starter" vs
  "Professional")?
- **Feature Highlights:** Are only the 3-5 most important features listed for
  each plan initially?
- **Comparison Table:** Is there a detailed comparison for "power users" below
  the main cards?

### 3. Apply Psychological Triggers

- **Anchoring:** If appropriate, place the most expensive plan first (left) to
  make others look cheaper, or emphasize the highest value.
- **Decoy Effect:** Ensure middle tiers provide clearly better value than the
  base tier to encourage upgrades.
- **Price Framing:** Show "Price per month, billed annually" to make the number
  smaller, but be transparent.

### 4. Risk Reversal & Trust Signals

- **The "Safety Net":** Place a money-back guarantee or "Cancel anytime" notice
  near the CTAs.
- **Contextual FAQs:** Answer the 3 most common pricing questions right on the
  page.
- **Social Proof:** Include testimonials or "Trusted by..." logos specifically
  relevant to the pricing/value.

### 5. Review Against Decision Rules

Ensure the proposed changes align with the growth heuristics below.

## Decision Rules

- **The Power of Three:** Ideally, offer three tiers (Good/Better/Best). It
  provides enough choice without overwhelming.
- **Center Stage:** The "Most Popular" or "Recommended" plan should be in the
  center and visually highlighted (larger, different color, or badged).
- **Action-Oriented CTAs:** Use benefit-driven text on buttons (e.g., "Get
  Started with Pro" instead of "Select Plan").
- **Transparency:** No hidden fees. If there are add-ons, mention them clearly
  or include them in a higher tier.

## Constraints

- **Pricing Accuracy:** All plan features, limits, and prices must reflect the actual product — inaccurate pricing pages create support burden and increase churn.
- **Business Approval:** Changes to plan structure, pricing tiers, or feature positioning require product and finance sign-off.
- **Billing FAQ:** Frequently asked billing questions (upgrades, cancellations, refunds) must be addressed accurately and not omitted for brevity.

## Non-Goals

- Setting pricing strategy, determining plan feature sets, or defining trial terms.
- Configuring billing systems, payment gateways, or subscription logic.
- Contract and enterprise pricing negotiation flows.

## Common Failure Patterns

- **Feature Dumping:** Listing 20+ features in the main pricing cards, making
  them hard to scan.
- **Invisible Differences:** Plans that look identical except for one minor
  technical limit.
- **CTA Sameness:** Making all "Buy" buttons look exactly the same, giving no
  guidance on which to pick.
- **Lack of Currency/Regional Context:** Not showing the correct currency or
  local pricing if the business is global.

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] **Preference Testing:** Show users two versions and ask which plan they would
  pick and why.
- [ ] **Conversion to Checkout:** Measure the percentage of pricing page visitors
  who click a "Buy" or "Sign Up" button.
- [ ] **AOV Analysis:** Compare the average order value before and after
  optimization.
- [ ] **Customer Support Tickets:** Monitor if "Which plan should I get?" questions
  decrease after the update.
