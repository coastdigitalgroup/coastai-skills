# Fluid Spacing System

## Purpose

The Fluid Spacing System skill provides a methodology for creating a responsive
scale of white space (margins, paddings, gaps) that adapts smoothly to the
user's viewport. By using the CSS `clamp()` function, spacing scales linearly
between defined minimum and maximum values, maintaining visual harmony and
consistent proportions without the need for excessive media queries.

## Use Cases

- Establishing a foundational spacing scale for a new design system.
- Modernizing a website to improve visual consistency across mobile, tablet, and
  desktop.
- Designing high-quality layouts where white space needs to breathe on large
  screens but stay compact on small ones.
- Replacing fixed pixel-based spacing with a more flexible, implementation-aware
  system.

## When NOT to Use

- **Simple, Non-Responsive Pages:** If the layout is extremely basic or has no
  responsive requirements.
- **Strictly Fixed Layouts:** When the design specifications mandate exact,
  non-negotiable pixel values at every resolution.
- **Legacy Browser Support:** If the target audience primarily uses browsers
  that do not support CSS `clamp()` (e.g., Internet Explorer).

## Inputs

To generate a fluid spacing system, you need:

1. **Viewport Range:**
   - `min-width`: The screen width where scaling starts (e.g., 320px).
   - `max-width`: The screen width where scaling stops (e.g., 1280px).
2. **Base Spacing Unit:**
   - `min-size`: The base unit (e.g., 16px) at `min-width`.
   - `max-size`: The base unit (e.g., 20px) at `max-width`.
3. **Scale Ratio:**
   - A multiplier to determine the steps in the scale (e.g., 1.25 for a Major
     Third scale, or a linear 2x/3x/4x progression).

## Outputs

1. **Fluid Spacing Scale:** A set of CSS variables defining values from "tiny"
   to "huge" using `clamp()`.
2. **Semantic Mapping:** Guidelines on how to apply these tokens (e.g.,
   `--space-m` for component padding, `--space-xl` for section margins).
3. **Usage Documentation:** Rules for combining units to maintain vertical
   rhythm and horizontal alignment.

## Workflow

### 1. Define the Scale Parameters

Set the boundaries for your fluid system based on the project's target devices.
_Example:_ 320px (Mobile) to 1440px (Desktop), with a base unit scaling from
16px to 24px.

### 2. Choose a Spacing Ratio

Decide how the spacing steps should grow.

- **Linear/Multiplicative:** Steps are multiples of the base unit (e.g., 0.5x,
  1x, 1.5x, 2x, 4x, 8x). Best for predictable alignment.
- **Geometric Scale:** Each step is the previous step multiplied by a ratio
  (e.g., 1.25). Best for high-contrast, artistic layouts.

### 3. Calculate Scale Steps

Create a range of sizes. A typical scale includes:

- **3XS to XS:** For tiny details, tight lists, and internal button padding.
- **S to M:** For standard component spacing and gutters.
- **L to 3XL:** For section margins, hero spacing, and major layout gaps.

### 4. Generate CSS `clamp()` Formulas

Convert pixel values into fluid formulas.
`clamp(min_rem, intercept_rem + slope_vw, max_rem)`

_Slope calculation:_ `(max_px - min_px) / (max_viewport - min_viewport) * 100`

### 5. Assign Semantic Roles

Map the abstract scale to functional roles to ensure consistency across the
team.

- `space-component`: `--space-s`
- `space-layout-gutter`: `--space-m`
- `space-section`: `--space-xl`

## Decision Rules

- **The 8pt Grid Principle:** Whenever possible, ensure your min/max values are
  multiples of 4 or 8 to align with standard UI patterns.
- **Proximity Principle:** Elements that are related should have less space
  between them than elements that are unrelated.
- **Mobile Compression:** Keep smaller spacing units (3XS-S) relatively stable;
  only larger units (L-3XL) should scale aggressively to prevent mobile layouts
  from feeling "exploded."
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that even at the smallest scale, interactive
  elements maintain a large enough hit area (minimum 24x24px per WCAG 2.2 SC
  2.5.8, including padding; 44x44px preferred for primary actions).
- **Container-Relative Spacing:** For spacing that should respond to a
  component's container rather than the viewport (e.g., a card that can sit in
  a narrow sidebar or a wide main column), use container query length units
  (`cqi`/`cqw`) inside the `clamp()` formula instead of `vw`.

## Constraints

- **Responsiveness:** Spacing should never cause horizontal overflow.
- **Consistency:** Once a scale is defined, do not use "one-off" pixel values.
- **Hierarchy:** Larger spacing should always be used to separate larger blocks
  of content (e.g., sections), while smaller spacing is for internal component
  details.

## Non-Goals

- Creating a layout grid (use the `responsive-grid-system` skill for that).
- Defining typography sizes (use the `fluid-typography-system` skill).
- Managing z-index or layering.

## Common Failure Patterns

- **Scaling Everything Equally:** Scaling small paddings (like 4px) too much can
  make components look distorted on desktop.
- **Ignoring Layout Gutters:** Having fluid component spacing but fixed grid
  gutters, leading to alignment "drift."
- **Overwhelming Scale:** Having 20+ different spacing steps makes the system
  hard to use and maintain. Aim for 7-9 steps.
- **No Logical Steps:** Using arbitrary numbers instead of a consistent scale or
  ratio.

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Spacing scales smoothly when the viewport is resized.
- [ ] Vertical rhythm is maintained across all major breakpoints.
- [ ] No "one-off" pixel values are used in the implementation; all spacing uses
      the defined variables.
- [ ] The system uses `rem` units for the minimum and maximum bounds of the
      `clamp()` function.
- [ ] Proximity and hierarchy are reinforced by the spacing choices.
- [ ] Interactive elements retain at least a 24x24px hit area (WCAG 2.2 SC
      2.5.8) at every point on the fluid scale, including the smallest
      viewport.
